I want you to generate a complete technical plan and implementation blueprint for a full-stack web application with the following requirements. Only describe architecture, responsibilities, folder structure, components, flows, and integration logic.

**Tech Stack:**

* Next.js (React Framework)
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* shadcn/ui for components
* Markdown rendering for blog articles
* Perplexity API for AI article generation
* Vercel Postgres as the database
* Deployment will be on Vercel

**Primary Goal:**
Build a system where I can input a list of blog titles, and the application will generate full article content using the Perplexity API, save each article to the database, and publish them on the site as markdown-rendered blog pages.

**Your Output Should Include:**

1. **Overall architecture explanation** (frontend, backend, database, API layers).
2. **Detailed project folder structure** (all folders + purpose).
3. **List of required environment variables** and how the app will use them.
4. **Database schema design** (tables, fields, relationships, constraints).
5. **Flow: blog article generation using Perplexity API**

   * Input format
   * API request blueprint
   * Response handling flow
   * Markdown storage strategy
   * Slug generation rules
6. **Flow: fetching and displaying blogs**

   * Blog listing
   * Blog detail page
   * Markdown rendering pipeline
7. **Frontend UI/UX requirements**

   * Pages and their responsibilities
   * Components needed (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
   * State handling
8. **API routes design** (no code, just what each route does).
9. **Security considerations** (rate limits, validation, sanitation, markdown safety).
10. **Vercel deployment instructions** (repo setup, env vars, build steps).
11. **Additional recommended optimizations** (ISR, caching, edge functions, pagination, error handling).

**Important:**

* Focus on system design, structure, flows, and implementation details.
* Make the plan production-ready.
